# btrace

A safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform

## Version
2.2.3

## Quick Summary
BTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform.

BTrace can be used to dynamically trace a running Java program (similar to DTrace for OpenSolaris applications and OS). BTrace dynamically instruments the classes of the target application to inject tracing code ("bytecode tracing").

* Based on [ASM](http://asm.ow2.org/)
* Powered by [JCTools](https://github.com/JCTools/JCTools)
* Powered by [hppcrt](https://github.com/vsonnier/hppcrt)
* Optimized with [JProfiler Java Profiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)
* Build env helper using [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

## Building BTrace

### Setup
You will need the following applications installed

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* __JDKs__ - JDK 8, Java 9 and Java 11 are required to be available
* (optionally, the default launcher is the bundled `gradlew` wrapper) [Gradle](http://gradle.org)

In order to ease the pre-build config the `config_build.sh` script is provided. You should run it first as `source config_build.sh` to automatically download all required JDKs and set up the corresponding `JAVA_*_HOME` env variables.

### Build

#### Java
Your __JAVA_HOME__ must point to JDK 11 (eg. __JAVA_11_HOME__)

#### Gradle
```sh
cd <btrace>
./gradlew :btrace-dist:build
```
The binary dist packages can be found in `<btrace>/btrace-dist/build/distributions` as the *.tar.gz, *.zip, *.rpm and *.deb files.
The exploded binary folder which can be used right away is located at `<btrace>/btrace-dist/build/resources/main` which serves as the __BTRACE_HOME__ location.


## Using BTrace
### Installation
Download a distribution file from the [release page](https://github.com/btraceio/btrace/releases/latest). Explode the binary distribution file (either *.tar.gz or *.zip) to a directory of your choice.

You may set the system environment variable __BTRACE_HOME__ to point to the directory containing the exploded distribution.

You may enhance the system environment variable __PATH__ with __$BTRACE_HOME/bin__ for your convenience.

Or, alternatively, you may install one of the *.rpm or *.deb packages

### Running
* `<btrace>/bin/btrace <PID> <trace_script>` will attach to the __java__ application with the given __PID__ and compile and submit the trace script
* `<btrace>/bin/btracec <trace_script>` will compile the provided trace script
* `<btrace>/bin/btracer <compiled_script> <args to launch a java app>` will start the specified java application with the btrace agent running and the script previously compiled by *btracec* loaded

For the detailed user guide, please, check the [Wiki](https://github.com/btraceio/btrace/wiki/Home).

### Maven Integration
The [maven plugin](https://github.com/btraceio/btrace-maven) is providing easy compilation of __BTrace__ scripts as a part of the build process. As a bonus you can utilize the _BTrace Project Archetype_ to bootstrap developing __BTrace__ scripts.

### Deb Repository

Using the command line, add the following to your /etc/apt/sources.list system config file:

```
echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/btraceio/deb xenial universe" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Or, add the repository URLs using the "Software Sources" admin UI:

```
deb http://dl.bintray.com/btraceio/deb xenial universe
```

### RPM Repository

Grab the _*.repo_ file `wget https://bintray.com/btraceio/rpm/rpm -O bintray-btraceio-rpm.repo` and use it.
